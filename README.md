> DESCRIPTION:

Silkie Bugbear's Cheat Menu is a mod dedicated to updating "DP's Cheat Mod" by removing unnecessarily toxic text from my escapist entertainment. 
Shared in case others have similar preferences. 


Silkie Bugbear's Cheat Menu is based on DP 1.1.9, which ports most of the options of the mod "Sketchy Cheat Menu" from CK2 to CK3 with a slower & unnecessarily elaborate UI.
Working to fix the annoyance, SUBSCRIBE to be notified when done.

Please suggest any edits in comments, and I'll try to address them in a new version.
