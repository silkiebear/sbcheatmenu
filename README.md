> DESCRIPTION:

Silkie BugBear's Cheat Menu is a mod dedicated to bringing "DP's Cheat Mod" into the 21st century by removing unnecessarily toxic text from my escapist entertainment. Shared in case others have similar preferences. 

DP ports most of the options of the mod "Sketchy Cheat Menu" from CK2 into CK3, with some omissions, and an irritatingly slower unnecessarily elaborate UI (working on changing this in a new version, SUBSCRIBE to be notified when I'm done). 

Based on DP 1.1.9.

Please suggest any edits in comments, and I will try to address them in a new version.


> Information:
